# Transistor-Circuit-Design
transistor circuit design in proteus
Overview
This project is transistor circuit design  simulation created in Proteus (version 8.14).he goal is to provide a virtual platform for designing and testing transistor-based circuits. The application allows users to explore various transistor configurations, simulate their behavior, and gain insights into transistor circuit design principles.

# Getting Started
Prerequisites
Proteus 8.14: Download Link
